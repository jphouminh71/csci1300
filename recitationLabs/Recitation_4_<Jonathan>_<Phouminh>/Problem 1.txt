/*
    calcPay function accepts two parameters, doesn't return anything
        1. redefine all accepted variables and new variables to be used
        2. set 3 conditional statements, one checking to make sure all passed varibles are positive
                        - prints a statemet telling the person that their input is invalid
        another conditional that is ONLY evaluated if hours worked is less than or equal to 40
                        - Calculates and prints the normal pay rate
        Last conditional that is only evaluated if hours_worked is greater than 40. 
                        - Calculates normal pay rate for the first 40 hours
                        - Calculates the amount of money earned for the remaining hours over 40
                        - Update the normal 40 hours of money earned with the extra amount of money
                        - print pay
        3. main()
            - Passes parameters
            - Multiple Test Cases
